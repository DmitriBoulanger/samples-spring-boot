### Code Design
  * Model is based on Objects and not primitives that allows nullify requests and have null values for data
  that wasn't provided by docker daemon.
  * For null safeness findbugs annotations are used.
  ** Every method that may return `null` (and we are unsure in any fields as docker daemon may change something)
     should be annotated with `@CheckForNull` return qualifier from `javax.annotation` package.
  ** Methods that can't return `null` must be annotated with `@Nonnull`.
  ** The same for Arguments.
  ** `@Nullable` must be used only for changing inherited (other typed) qualifier.
  * Setters in builder style must be prefixed with `withXX`.
  * All classes should provide `toString()` `equals()` and `hashCode()` defined methods.
  * Javadocs
  ** Provide full information on field:
  *** For models define API version with `@since {@link RemoteApiVersion#VERSION_1_X}`.
  ** getters/setters should refernce to field `@see #$field`.
  * If it is `Serializable` it shall have a `serialVersionUID` field. Unless code has shipped to users, the initial value of the `serialVersionUID` field shall be `1L`.

### Coding style
  * TBD, some initial styling already enforced with checkstyle.
  IDEA/checkstyle file analogues will be provided soon.

### Testing
  * Unit tests for serder (serialization-deserialization).
  * Integration tests for commands.
  * If model object has builders, then fill it with data and compare by `equals()` with expected response
  from docker daemon. If failed, then some fields mappings are wrong.

### Debug
  * When there are unreproducible Travis errors:
  ** Try locally run test 10-20 times in IDE against the same docker daemon version and same connection type (tcp or socket).
  ** Limit `.travis.yml` to single run (to not consume their resources with matrix run).
  ** Remove `travis-logback.xml` replacement (build can't output everything in every run because travis has log limitation).
  ** Set single test in `pom.xml` `for maven-failsafe-plugin`
  ** Make PR or if you are maintainer push to branch, catch log and fix.
