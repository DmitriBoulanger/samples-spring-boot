## Response Times

This project is developed and maintained by an infrastructure team at Spotify. Lots of teams at
Spotify use relatively recent versions of this project in production for mission-critical systems.

That being said, this is our day job where our primary users are our colleagues.
So we might be slow in getting back to you because we're busy working on Spotify-specific things
or because your issues are being prioritized behind those of our colleagues.

Please poke us if you feel you're being neglected, and we'll do our best to get back to you.
