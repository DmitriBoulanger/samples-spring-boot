[[docker:remove]]
== *docker:remove*

This goal can be used to clean up images and containers. By default all so called _data images_ are removed with its containers. A data image is an image without a run configuration. This can be tuned by providing the properties `removeAll` which indicates to remove all images managed by this build. As with the other goals, the configuration `image` can be used to tune the images to remove. All containers belonging to the images are removed as well.

Considering three images 'db','tomcat' and 'data' where 'data' is the only data images this example demonstrates the effect of this goal:

* `mvn {plugin}:remove` will remove 'data'
* `mvn -Ddocker.removeAll {plugin}:remove` will remove all three images
* `mvn -Ddocker.image=data,tomcat {plugin}:remove` will remove 'data'
* `mvn -Ddocker.image=data,tomcat -Ddocker.removeAll {plugin}:remove` will remove 'data' and 'tomcat'
