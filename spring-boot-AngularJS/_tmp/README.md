# spring-hateoas-sample

A working Spring Boot + Spring HATEOAS application implementing a hypermedia API supporting HAL <http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html>

Look at the related blog post: [Implementing HAL hypermedia REST API using Spring HATEOAS](https://opencredo.com/hal-hypermedia-api-spring-hateoas/)
    
## Usage
### Running the Spring Boot app
Navigate to the directory into which you cloned the repo and execute this:
```
$ mvn spring-boot:run
```
  
Once started you can access the APIs on port 8080, e.g.
```
$ curl http://localhost:8080/books
``` 
  
The port number can be changed by editing the port property in `src/main/resources/application.yml`  or setting the `server.port` property, e.g. `server.port=80`

  
### Load sample data

By default, the application database starts empty. 
To load sample data on start, launch the application with `-Dloadsampledata=true` 
```
$ mvn spring-boot:run -Dloadsampledata=true
```

### Run with external H2 database

You may run the application using an external H2 running in server mode on the same machine

- Download and install (unzip) H2 http://www.h2database.com/html/download.html
- Start H2 in server mode (replace `<h2-dir>` with H2 installation directory, and `<data-dir>` with your preferred data directory (enabling H2 web console is not required)
```
$ java -cp <h2-dir>/bin/h2*.jar org.h2.tools.Server -web -webPort 8081 -tcp -tcpAllowOthers -tcpPort 1521 -baseDir <data-dir>
```
- Start the application with `-Dexternaldb=true`
```
$ mvn spring-boot:run -Dexternaldb=true -Dloadsampledata=true
```

### Running the executable JAR

`mvn package` creates an executable jar that may be launched directly

```
$ java -Dloadsampledata=true -jar target/spring-hateoas-sample-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
